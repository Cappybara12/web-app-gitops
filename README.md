# Implementation of ArgoCD for Canary Deployment ASSIGNMENT

## Introduction
This documentation outlines the implementation of ArgoCD for a canary deployment strategy. It covers the challenges encountered during the process, how they were resolved, and includes additional information such as cleanup steps and screenshots for visual representation.

---

## Setup ArgoCD Server
The initial setup of the ArgoCD server involved following official documentation and online tutorials. Post-restart issues were encountered but resolved by switching back to the correct Kubernetes context.

**Resolution:** Troubleshooting skills were utilized to identify and resolve configuration issues, ensuring the successful setup of the ArgoCD server.

---

## Rollout Definition with Canary Strategy
Creating a rollout definition with a canary strategy presented challenges related to invalid specifications and rollout failures.

**Resolution:** Through trial and error, the rollout.yaml file was corrected, and each step was configured according to ArgoCD's requirements. This experience enhanced understanding of canary deployments and YAML configurations.

---

## Docker Image Update and Deployment
Updating Docker images and deploying them via ArgoCD posed challenges regarding image version inconsistencies and rollout states.

**Resolution:** In-depth review and correction of rollout.yaml and deployment.yaml files led to successful image updates and rollout deployments, ensuring application stability.

---

## Additional Challenge: Integration with External Services
One notable challenge was integrating the application with external services, such as databases or APIs, to ensure seamless functionality during canary deployments.

**Resolution:** Extensive testing and coordination with backend teams were undertaken to ensure proper integration and functionality across all deployment stages.

## Clean Up
To cleanly remove all resources created during this assignment from the Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. **Delete Deployed Application:**
   Run the following command to delete the rollout my-app-rollout:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete rollout my-app-rollout
